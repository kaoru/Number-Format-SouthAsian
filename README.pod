Number::Format::SouthAsian - format numbers in the South Asian style

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Formats numbers in the South Asian style. You can read more on Wikipedia here:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asian_numbering_system

The format_number() method has a words parameter which tells it to use
words rather than simply separating the numbers with commas.

    my $formatter = Number::Format::SouthAsian->new();
    say $formatter->format_number(12345678);             # 1,23,45,678
    say $formatter->format_number(12345678, words => 1); # 1.2345678 crores

You can also specify words to new(), which has the effect of setting a
default value to be used.

    my $formatter = Number::Format::SouthAsian->new(words => 1);
    say $formatter->format_number(12345678);             # 1.2345678 crores
    say $formatter->format_number(12345678, words => 0); # 1,23,45,678

You can also specify "decimals" to either new() or format_number(), which has
the effect of rounding any decimals found. Note that this means slightly
different things depending on wordiness.

    my $rounding_formatter = Number::Format::SouthAsian->new(decimals => 2);
    say $rounding_formatter->format_number(1234.5678); # 1,234.57
    say $rounding_formatter->format_number(12345678, words => 1); # 1.23 crores

In India it is common to use lakhs and crores, but quite uncommon to see any of
the other larger number names. An "arab" is much more likely to be called "100
crores" and a "kharab" is more likely to be called a "lakh crore." This
behaviour can be enabled with the lakhs_and_crores_only parameter.

    my $lakhs_and_crores_only_formatter = Number::Format::SouthAsian->new(words => 1, lakhs_and_crores_only => 1);
    say $lakhs_and_crores_only_formatter->format_number(1_00_00_00_000); # 100 crores
